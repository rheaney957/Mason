### About Section

**Heading**: Our Story

**Content**:
```
For over 25 years, Heritage Restoration Services has been the trusted choice for lodges and collectors seeking to preserve their most cherished Masonic items.

What started as a passion project in a small workshop has grown into a full-service restoration studio, serving lodges and collectors across the region. Our founder, a third-generation craftsman and proud Mason, understood that these items are more than objects—they're connections to history, tradition, and brotherhood.

Every plaque, medal, and presentation piece that comes through our doors carries a story. Whether it's a tarnished cornerstone plaque from 1892 or a presentation gavel that's lost its luster, we treat each item with the reverence it deserves.

Our team combines time-honored restoration techniques with modern precision tools to deliver results that honor the past while ensuring durability for future generations.
